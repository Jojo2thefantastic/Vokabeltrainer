If your word has been saved it will tell you in a message under the input fields. If your word already exists 
in your database you'll also get a message that it is already saved and won't make a duplicate, so that your database stays clear and manageable.

You can add as many words to your database as you like, after every saving just press the reset button "Neues Wort" to get a fresh / clean input field. 
Also you can always go back to your homescreen with the Home Button.

### Quiz Window 

The Quiz works in that way that when you have words saved in your database it will either generate a german or an italian word that you have to translate.

If your translation is correct it will tell you so, otherwise you'll get a message with the correct translation.
